# DevHacks-2025




Gamified Budget Tracking app


Fun ideas:

In app currency, so once you reach a certain milestone, they get credit on the app that would allow them to unlock an achievement.

Use animation to make it more fun and interactive.

If they go over budget, the app lowers their in app currency.
Weekly budget (if you spend too much money on one day, the weekly budget reduces) and if they do not spend that much in that week (half goes into savings and the other stays in budget).

Including sound effects from popular game (eg subway surfers) – police yells at you when you overspend. If they go negative an alarm should sound.
